# About the project

Basic expense control application developed with Flutter, integrated with Firebase for authentication and data storage.

The application allows each user to control their accounts, add, edit, delete and even filter them. 

It also has a function for storing money, separate from the main budget, on which the user spends or earns.

In the profile we have a simple gamification scheme with the user's data, so they can get an idea of what has happened since they started using the app.
